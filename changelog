All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## \[v1.0.2] – 2025-05-03

### New Features

* Advanced Mode toggle: Enables block-level `iterations` (e.g., repeat a Tab 5× for 5 tab inputs)
* QR Label Input: Users can now add a custom label beneath the QR code
* Preset labels: Presets now store and restore the associated QR label
* Visual iteration tags: Blocks display `×N` when repeated in Advanced Mode

### Preset Format Update

* Presets are now stored as an object with a `label` and `blocks`, enabling richer metadata

  ```js
  {
    label: "My Label",
    blocks: [{ type: "text", label: "Example", iterations: 1 }]
  }
  ```
* Backward compatibility: Legacy array-based presets are automatically wrapped and converted

### UI and UX Improvements

* QR preview now uses a custom canvas to render both the code and its label in one image
* Copy-to-clipboard now includes this labeled composite image
* Minor UI polish: smaller spacing tweaks, consistent hover effects, and enhanced block visuals
* Color palette adjusted for visual harmony and accessibility (color blindness awareness)

### Improvements and Fixes

* `copySelectedPresetAsDefaultSnippet()` now reflects new preset structure (with label and iterations)
* Tooltip and layout alignment adjustments
* Code cleanup and improved consistency in `BlockManager`, `Drag`, and `PresetsManager`
